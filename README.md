This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

- Course: VR High Immersion
- Project: Rube Goldberg game
- By Christopher DiCarlo
- Built for SteamVR
- Oculus Rift was used to test and develop this project
- The Rube Goldberg game is a VR experience where the player must build a path from a start platform to an end goal using objects they can spawn from an object menu. In order to unlock the goal, the ball must pass through and collect all of the stars present on the level without touching the ground.

### Reflection Notes
- This project took me about 9 days from the time I started it to finishing it. I worked on it for multiple hours each day.
- One thing I liked about working on this project was that it was my first time working on a desktop VR game. It was exciting to create the functionality using the latest tools available in SteamVR.
- One challenge I faced was that there is not a lot of documentation for SteamVR or answers online for issues I had while using it. I spent many hours trying to get the Controller Button Hint system working but in the end was not able to. Even when I found people having the same issues I was having there were not any replies with answers about it.
